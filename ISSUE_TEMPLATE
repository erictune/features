Thanks for wanting to add a feature to Kubernetes!  You will be responsible for guiding
your feature through completion, and asking the right people for approvals.  You can use the checkboxes below to
track your progress.  You can delete the text above once you have read it.  Please keep the checklist.

- [ ] Propose your feature.  See [Advice for proposing features].  
   - Start with a < 1 page description in an issue comment below this.
   - Request an initial feature review by mentioning @kubernetes/new-feature-reviewers.  
   - Keep pinging that every few days if you don't get a response.
   - If the feature is simple, the approver might ask you to [write a longer design doc](writing_longer_design_docs.md).
   - If there is a design doc, that goes in a PR under github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/docs/proposals.  Link that PR on this issue.
   - Once you get LGTM from a feature reviewer, you can check this checkbox, and the reviewer will apply the "feature-lgtm" label.
- [ ] Write code and tests get them merged.
      - Use as many PRs as you need.  Write tests in the same or different PRs, as is convenient for you.
      - As each PR is merged, add a comment to this issue referencing the PRs.  Code goes in the http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes repository,
        and sometimes http://github.com/kubernetes/contrib, or other repos.
      - When you are done with the code, apply the "code-complete" label.
      - When the feature has user docs, please add a comment mentioning @kubernetes/feature-complete-reviewers and they will
        check that the code matches the proposed feature and design, and that everything is done, and that there is adequate
        testing.  They won't do detailed code review: that already happened when your PRs were reviewed.
        When that is done, you can check this box and the reviewer will apply the "code-complete" label.
- [ ] Write user docs and get them merged in.
     - User docs go into http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io.
     - When the feature has user docs, please add a comment mentioning @kubernetes/docs-reviews.
     - When you get LGTM, you can check this checkbox, and the reviewer will apply the "docs-complete" label.
- [ ] And so on...
