# Kubernetes feature issues repository

This repository is just for holding issues that track new feature work in the Kubernetes organization.

Any large user-visible change to http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes needs a new issue in this repository
to track work on the issue.  If you aren't sure if you need a new issue, see [Do I need a Feature Issue?](./do_i_need_a_feature_issue.md)

We keep the feature issues in a separate repository so that we can allow more users access to edit labels on the features,
and so that we can use the same template for all feature issues.
Feature work typically spans multiple repositories anyhow: features usually have docs in http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io and code in http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.

When you create a new issue, a template will be included at the top of the issue which indicates what steps you should follow
and what approvals you will need.
